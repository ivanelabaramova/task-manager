# Task Manager
A console-based project for managing tasks and grouping them into stories.
## Description 
This is a project to apply the programming knowledge I have gained so far and to challenge myself. 

In this console application you could use certain commands to:
- Create Story -> create a new story and give it: *name, description, points* 
- Add Task -> add a task to an existing story and give it: *name, description*
- Delete Task -> delete a task from a story
- Complete Task -> complete a task from a story - change the status from active to closed
- Print Story -> print an existing story with all its tasks
- Print All Stories -> print all stories with their included tasks
## Technologies
- Java 15
